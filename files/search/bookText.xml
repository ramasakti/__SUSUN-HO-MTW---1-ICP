                                              Bismillaahirrahmaanirrahiim


                        Alhamdulillahirabbil 'alamin. All praise belongs to Allah, whom we worship and

                 ask  for  help.  Salawat  and  salam  may  continue  to  be  bestowed  on  our  Prophet

                 Muhammad PBUH, including his family, companions, and followers.


                        Perguruan Islam Raudlatul Jannah always strives to provide the best education
                 for  the  students  entrusted  to  us.  The  Academic  Team  of  PG  (college),  TK

                 (kindergarten),  SD  (primary  school),  and  SMP  (secondary  school)  Islam  Raudlatul

                 Jannah has developed a Handout as a reference for teachers to manage the learning
                 process and for parents to monitor their children's learning rhythm, as well as their

                 personal growth and development. In addition, the Handout is an innovation in the
                 education system published and utilised by SD Islam Raudlatul Jannah 2.



                        This Handout is expected to support the learning process at SD Islam Raudlatul
                 Jannah 2 and assist children in being Independent Learners and having a Spiritual

                 Perspective. Besides, we hope our efforts will bring us to success both in dunya and

                 hereafter and always be blessed by Allah. Ameen.

                                                        Preface
                                              Bismillaahirrahmaanirrahiim

                        All praise is due to Allah, the Most Gracious and the Most Merciful. If it wasn't
                 for His love, the teachers of this school pioneering the Visi Semesta education system
                 would not have been able to put their intellectual energy into completing this Handout
                 as one of the learning media for our students. Salawat and salam may continue to be
                 bestowed on our Prophet Muhammad PBUH.  Thanks to his teachings, the spirit of
                 improving the quality of education initiated by various parties has rapidly grown in
                 various parts of the world.

                        The field of education is not only about the technical matters of teaching and
                 learning tools but also about the educational paradigm that underlies the educational
                 praxis in schools. Based on that paradigm, we decided to develop teaching-learning
                 tools. In line with this matter, it should be noted seriously that the world education
                 paradigm has now shifted from content-based to competency-based, from teaching
                 to learning, and from conventional to contextual. This paradigm shift underlined
                 our effort to develop a handout to hone students' competencies and provide contextual
                 thinking space for them to learn. Thus, the learning outcomes are primarily directed
                 toward  learn  how  to  learn,  more  than  just  summarising  learning  materials  from
                 various sources.

                        This Handout will be significantly more beneficial when students understand
                 how to learn, teachers are proficient at managing the learning process, and parents
                 master  learning  mentoring  strategies  to  help  students  grow  and  develop  into
                 independent learners. For this reason, this Handout is also equipped with learning
                 outcomes (knowledge, understanding, skills, values), adjusted to the competency
                 standards  and  basic  competencies  of  the  National  Curriculum.  This  Handout  is
                 expected to be beneficial for teachers to manage the learning process and for parents
                 to monitor their children's learning rhythm, personal growth, and development.

                        As a teaching and learning tool, we believe that this Handout is an ideal work.
                 However,  despite  all  the  possible  shortcomings,  this  Handout  is  expected  to  be
                 significantly beneficial for our children to build the staircase to the future. Therefore,
                 the intellectual performance behind the development process of this Handout needs
                 to be positively appreciated. May all the hard work of all parties involved be regarded
                 as worship in the sight of Allah. Ameen.

                                                        Preface
                                              Bismillaahirrahmaanirrahiim

                     Alhamdulillah.  First  and  foremost,  we  present  our  most  profound  gratitude  to
                 Allah, the Almighty, for blessing our lives always to be helpful to others, guiding us to
                 stay in His path, and giving us strength to always fight for our religion through a dawah
                 institution in the educational field. Salawat and salam may continue to be bestowed on
                 Prophet Muhammad PBUH, the true teacher who taught us to raise our children, the
                 true leader who lovingly led us to the true meaning of life.

                     The Government has stipulated the implementation of the integrated thematic-
                 based Independent Curriculum or Kurikulum Merdeka for public and private schools.
                 For  this  reason,  SDI  Raudlatul  Jannah  2  adopts  the  Independent  Curriculum  in  its
                 teaching and learning process with a learning approach/strategy of the Visi Semesta

                 education  system,  which  is  rich  in  values.  SD  Islam  Raudlatul  Jannah  2  applies  6
                 learning  themes:  Ourselves,  Environment,  Technology,  Entrepreneurship,
                 Changing the World, and Managing the World. With these themes, SDI Raudlatul
                 Jannah 2 students are expected to become Muslim generations who are able to manage
                 the world.

                     With this learning system, we put our best effort into making our own learning
                 handout that is compatible with the learning system of SD Islam Raudlatul Jannah 2.
                 This Handout is one of the learning tools for students because they will also utilise
                 many other learning resources, such as textbooks, newspapers/magazines, reference
                 books,  internet  articles,  etc.,  in  their  learning  to  help  them  better  understand  the
                 learning materials.

                     We intend to prepare students to be ready for future challenges. Thereby, this
                 Handout is expected to be capable of developing children's skills they will be required
                 to  have  in  the  next  10-15  years.  We  realise  that  this  Handout  is  far  from  perfect.
                 Therefore, any constructive suggestions are highly pleased to improve the learning
                 quality of our children further.

                  “Katakanlah: Terangkanlah kepadaku jika sumber air kamu menjadi kering; maka
                          siapakah yang akan mendatangkan air yang mengalir bagimu?"
                                                   (QS. Al Mulk: 30)



                       Aliya goes to grandma's house in village. Behind grandma's house there is a river
               whose  water  is  very  clear.  Villagers  use  the
               water  for  bathing  and  washing.  The  river

               drains     water     from     the     mountains.

               MasyaAllah.. really only Allah can create and
               bring flowing water for humans. As explained

               in  the  Quran  Surah  Al  Mulk  verse  30  that  if
               the  water  source  is  dry,  then  only  Allah  can
                                                                               Source: google.com
               bring flowing water for humans.

                       As  explained  in  the  Al-Qur'an  that  Allah  has  given  extraordinary  blessings  to
               humans, humans should always be grateful by guarding and caring for what Allah SWT

               has given.

                                               clean water shortages. A Yahudi who has a well wanted to

                                               make a lot of profit, so he required all residents of Madina
                                               to buy his clean water. Hearing this, Utsman bin Affan also

                                               bought the well. Raumah well was able to overcome the

                                               drought problem faced by Muslims at that time. In fact,

               its usefulness has been felt to this day because the land around the well can be used as a

               date garden and it is managed by the Saudi Arabian government.

               Look at the picture of planet Earth.

               Some  parts  of  the  surface  of  Earth  are  dry  land,  but  some  parts  are

               covered by water.

                       When a person who believes in Allah observes everything and the existing systems

               (living  or  non-living)  in  the  universe  with  an  attentive  eye,  he  sees  that  everything  has
               been created for human beings. He knows that nothing arises and comes into being in the

               world by chance.

               make up the Solar System, in the galaxy known as the Milky Way. Our planet is unique for

               many reasons, but its available water and oxygen are two defining features. Water covers
               roughly 71% of Earth's surface, with most of that water located in our planet's oceans.

                                        KNOWING ABOUT FINE ART

               So, what can we do?
               The solution is not to litter.

               Like the following story, the Prophet who cares about the environment.





                                           It  is  said,  in  a  hadith  narrated  by  Abu  Dawud  that  the
                                           Prophet  forbade  his  companions  to  pollute  water.

                                           Rasulullah also conveyed several things to preserve the
                                           environment. Among them, the Prophet forbade polluting

                                           water,  saving  water,  planting  plants,  reviving  dead  soil,

                                           maintaining  cleanliness  and  environmental  safety.

                                                              21

               Managing waste is one way to reduce the amount of waste.
               So that our environment remains clean and healthy.

               The 3R principle (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) is a way to manage waste.




               We should try to reduce the amount of waste.

               Reduce the use of single-use items, such as plastic bags or plastic bottles.

               We can bring a bag when shopping or use a refillable water bottle.




               We must reuse items that can still be used.

               For example, used glass bottles can be reused to store drinks or food.
               By  reusing  these  items,  we  can  reduce the  amount of  waste  generated  and  also  save

               money.




               We should utilize recyclable waste.

               Recyclable waste includes paper, plastic, metal and glass.

               Recycling is the process of reprocessing waste into new raw materials that can be used
               to make new products.

               One example of recycling waste is collage art from waste paper.
               In the process of making collage art from used items, there are several techniques that

               can be used, among others:





               Gluing  technique  is  a  technique  to  glue  one  object  to  another  or  glue  one  side  of  the
               object to the other side so that it becomes a good and interesting work.











                                                                                 Sumber: https://www.pinterest.com

               Folding technique is a technique to fold an object to make a good and interesting work.


















               Cutting technique is a technique to cut objects into the parts we want.

                        bulan itu terbenam dia berkata, “Sungguh, jika Tuhanku tidak memberi petunjuk
                        kepadaku, pastilah aku termasuk orang-orang yang sesat. Kemudian ketika dia
                       melihat matahari terbit, dia berkata, “Inilah Tuhanku, ini lebih besar.” Tetapi ketika
                        matahari terbenam, dia berkata, “Wahai kaumku! Sungguh, aku berlepas diri dari
                                     apa yang kamu persekutukan.” (QS. Al Anam:77-78)





                       Rizal  always  diligently  recites  the  Al-Qur’an.  He
               was always impatient when he finished reciting the ustadz

               telling stories of the prophets. Rizal listened to the story of

               the  prophet  Ibrahim  looking  for  Allah  with  great
               enthusiasm.  Ustadz  conveyed  the  contents  of  QS.  Al

               Anam verses 77-78 that through the intelligence possessed by the prophet  Ibrahim, he
               could seek Allah through various forms that exist on earth. Ustadz also reminded that as

               a  Muslim  one  must  always  worship  Allah  SWT.  Do  you  know  the  story?  Let's  see  the
               story!




                        THE STORY OF PROPHET IBRAHIM SEEKS GOD THROUGH THE MOON AND THE SUN






















                                                              25

                                     Prophet Ibrahim was confused when he saw many

                                     people including his parents worshiping idols which were
                                     only inanimate objects. Prophet Ibrahim did not believe
                                     that man-made idols were a God who should be
                                     worshiped, so he began to search for the real God. At

                                     that time, Allah gave blessings in the form of intelligent

                                     thoughts to Prophet Ibrahim so that he also thought it
                                     was impossible for the idol to be a god because he could

                                     not move let alone provide protection for mankind. Then

                                     he wondered what or who God was.



                                Prophet Ibrahim thought that the moon, the sun, even the

                                stars, is god, but he realized that all these objects could


                                appear and disappear, of course the thing is not the god.

                                After traveling in search of God, Prophet Ibrahim realized

                                that the only god that must be worshiped is Allah SWT.

                                To  strengthen  his  faith  in  Allah  SWT,  Prophet  Ibrahim

                                also asked Allah to show him the power of Allah to revive

                                dead  creatures.  After  Allah  SWT  proved  his  power,
                                Prophet  Ibrahim  AS  grew  more  faith  in  Allah  SWT  and

                                confirmed  that  Allah  is  the  almighty  substance  and  the
                                only god who must be worshiped.








                                     CHARACTERISTICS OF 2D SHAPES

                 Salih-salihah, Alhamdulillah we have listened to the story of the prophet Ibrahim when

               he was looking for Allah. There are many forms of objects when the prophet Ibrahim was

               looking  for  Allah,  such  as  the  sun  and  moon  have  a  circle  shape.  After  learning  to
               recognize the names of 2D shapes on objects around us, let's find out the characteristics

               of 2D shapes!

                                            ROTATIONAL SYMMETRY





                  Rotational l symmetry in 2D shapes is the number of rotations a flat shape can make
                    to fit its frame so that the shapes look the same.
                  Many geometrical shapes appear to be symmetrical when they are rotated                    or
                    with  some  corners,  clockwise  or  anticlockwise.  Some  of  the  examples  are  square,
                    circle, hexagon, etc. A scalene triangle does not have symmetry if rotated since the
                    shape is asymmetrical.

               Steps:

                   1.  Take fold paper and draw a 2d shape (rectangle) using a ruler!

                   2.  Cut out the resulting 2D shape (rectangle) that you have made!
                   3.  Trace the 2D shape (rectangle) on an HVS paper!

                   4.  Determine the center point!

                   5.  Place  the  rectangular  shape  cutout  right  on  top  of  the  rectangular  picture  you
                       made!

                   6.  Try rotating the 2D shape (rectangle) clockwise!
                   7.  Can  the  rectangular  shape  that  you  cut  out  fulfill  the  line  you  made

                       exactly?.................................

                   8.  Try to rotate again until it is in its original position!
                   9.  How many times can a 2D shape (rectangle) loop occupy its frame? When played

                       one full time?................................................


               The 2D rectangle that you have created is named the ABCD rectangle with the center
               point at O. Look at the following picture!

                       From  the  activity  above,  you  can  see  that  a  rectangular  shape  can  occupy  its

               frame  twice  in  one  round,  namely  in  Figure  5  and  Figure  7.  Because  a  rectangle  can
               occupy  its  frame  twice,  it  can  be  said  that  a  rectangular  shape  has  two  rotational

               symmetries.

                               Alhamdulillah,  the  great  power  of  Allah  SWT
                       has  given  us  minds  so  that  we  can  use  it  to
                       remember  the  characteristics  of  2D  shapes  and
                       recognize  rotational  symmetry  in  2D  shapes.  We
                       should  use  our  minds  well,  be  careful  and
                       conscientious individuals.

               Salih salihah, do you still remember the story of Prophet Nuh as?

               He is one of the caliphs on earth.

               Sent by Allah to invite his people to believe.

               It was a miracle that he was able to build such a large ship.

               This ship was the first ship made by humans.


               Let’s know the story!



                                        Salih salihah, do you know that            Yes,  miss.  I  have

                                        the ship of the Prophet Nuh (a.s.)         ever     heard     the

                                        was the first ship made by                 story.

                                        humans?







                                                    The ship of the Prophet Nuh AS was a very large

                                                    ship. This ship was the first ship made by humans.

                                                    The  ship  was  made  of  wood  collected  by  the

                                                    Prophet  Nuh  and  his  faithful  followers.  The  ship

                                                    was built on Allah's orders to save the believers of

                                                    the Prophet Nuh (a.s.) from a major flood disaster.

               Allah menunjukkan kebesarannya melalui banyak peristiwa.

               Salah satunya peristiwa banjir pada masa Nabi Nuh as.

               Suatu ketika, Nabi Nuh as berdoa kepada Allah swt.

               Nabi Nuh as berdoa supaya kaumnya diberi hidayah.
               Allah mengabulkan doa tersebut.

               Allah memerintahkan Nabi Nuh as untuk membuat perahu besar.

               Nabi  Nus  as  dan  orang-orang  yang  beriman
               membuat       perahu     di   atas    bukit.   Mereka

               menggunakan kayu untuk membuat kapal.
               Kaum  Nabi  Nuh  as  yang  keras  kepala  malah

               mengejek Nabi Nuh as.
               Mereka  bahkan  melempar  kotoran  kepada  Nabi

               Nuh as saat membuat kapal.


                                                              Setelah  kapal  selesai,  beliau  kemudian
                                                              mengajak  seluruh  kaumnya  untuk  masuk  ke

                                                              dalam kapal.
                                                              Nabi  Nuh  as  juga  membawa  serta  seluruh

               Selain itu Nabi Nuh as juga membawa benih tumbuh-tumbuhan.
               Awan mulai mendung disusul dengan suara gemuruh halilintar.

               Hujan lebat pun turun hingga terjadi banjir bandang.
               Kapal Nabi Nuh as mulai terangkat karena air membanjiri daratan.

               Tidak ada tempat yang aman dari banjir saat itu kecuali kapal Nabi Nuh as.

               Allah membinasakan kaum yang tidak beriman dalam banjir itu.

                                Spiritual Paradigm



                     “Dan kepada kaum ‘Ad (Kami utus) saudara mereka, Hud. Dia berkata, ‘Wahai

                     kaumku! Sembahlah Allah, tidak ada tuhan bagimu selain Dia. (Selama ini)

                     kamu hanyalah mengada-ada.” (Q.S. Hud: 50)



               Allah telah mengutus Nabi dan Rasulnya sebagai pemimpin.

               Nabi Hud as adalah salah satu Nabi yang diutus untuk memimpin dan berdakwah.
               Kaumnya yang keras kepala dan dzalim tidak membuatnya menyerah.

               Nabi Hud as tetap berusaha mengajak beriman kepada Allah.

               Sikap pemimpin seperti ini dapat kita contoh.
               Yuk simak kisah selengkapnya!

                                                  KISAH NABI HUD AS

                                                     Nabi Hud as tinggal di daerah Al-Ahqaf.
                                                     Sebuah daerah yang sangat indah karena memiliki

                                                     tanah yang subur.

                                                     Banyak hasil pertanian yang tumbuh dengan baik.
                                                     Di  sana  ada  kaum  ‘Ad  yang  hidup  dengan  amat

                                                     nyaman dan sejahtera.
               Kehidupan mereka makmur karena pertanian yang terhampar subur nan hijau.

               Hewan ternak yang sehat dan banyak, serta aliran air yang melimpah dan segar.


               Namun  kenikmatan  dilimpahkan  kepada  kaum

               ‘Ad tidak membuat mereka bersyukur.
               Mereka  justru  menyembah  patung  yang  diberi

               nama Shamud dan Alhattar.
               Nabi     Hud    as    menyerukan       ajaran    agar

               menyembah Allah.

               Nabi Hud as berjuang tiada henti untuk mengajak
               kebaikan.

               Namun kaum ‘Ad tidak mempercayai Nabi Hud as dan tetap menyembah berhala.


                                                            Kaum  ‘Ad  yang  sombong  dan  menentang

                                                            Nabi Hud as, mendapat peringatan dari Allah.
                                                            Musibah kekeringan menimpa kaum ‘Ad.

                                                            Pertanian  mereka  gagal  panen  sehingga
                                                            menyebabkan kelaparan.

                                                            Nabi  Hud  as  kembali  mengajak  kaum  ‘Ad

                                                            untuk berdoa kepada Allah.
                                                            Namun kaum ‘Ad tetap tidak mau.


               Akibat dari kaum ‘Ad yang terus menerus menyekutukan Allah Ta’ala.

               Allah  menunjukkan  kuasa-Nya  dengan  mendatangkan  gumpalan  awan  hitam  nan
               pekat.

               Allah menjatuhkan azab kepada kaum ‘Ad dengan angin topan yang dahsyat.

               Angin topan kencang tersebut membinasakan kaum ‘Ad.
               Sedangkan Nabi Hud as dan para pengikutnya tetap berdiam di rumah.

               Dengan pertolongan Allah, Nabi Hud as bersama orang-orang yang beriman selamat

                                                   Annisa’s hobby is drawing.

                                                   Annisa likes drawing natural landscapes.

                                                   At school, Annisa's friends also have hobbies.

                                                   They have different hobbies.


                                                   Even  though  they  are  different,  they  respect  each
                                                   other.


                            Source: google.com     Did you know, the Prophet also had a hobby.
               What is his favorite? Let's see his story






                                         Have  you  ever  heard  of  the  Prophet  doing

                                         sports?  What  kind  of  sport  does  the  Prophet

                                         like?

                                         The  Prophet  uses  the  time  to  the  best,  one  of

                                         them  by  exercising.  His  favorite  sports  are
                                         arrows,  horseback  riding  and  swimming.  The

                                         Prophet  loves  the  sport  because  in  addition  to

                                         healing the sport can train focus and discipline.









               Masyaallah, Rasulullah has a hobby that was very useful.

               We can imitate him, so that we can become strong Muslims and leaders.
               Everyone's hobbies or passion are different.

               Passion is one of a person's non-physical characteristics.

               What are non-physical characteristics? Let's learn together!

                                      NON-PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS


               Non-physical  characteristics  are  individual  characteristics  that  do  not  involve  the

               physical.

               Non-physical characteristics include religion, hobbies, favorite foods, characteristic, and
               so on.

               Each person has different characteristics.
               The students of grade 1, definitely have different hobbies.

               Some of their hobbies are playing football, drawing and reading books.

               Even though we have different hobbies, we still live in harmony and don't force each
               other's hobbies.

                               Maha Perkasa lagi Maha Mengetahui.” (Q.S Yasin:38)




                Raihan  goes  to  school when  the  sun  is in  the east,
               but  when  he  comes home from  school the sun  is in

               the west. He also asked his mother why the sun could
               move, then the mother replied that this was a sign of

               the oneness of Allah SWT, namely that the sun could

               circulate in its orbit. As in the qur'an surah Yasin: 38
               where the sun circulates in an orbit that Allah knows its levels,  without being able to

               exceed  it.  That  determination  is  the  determination  of  the  Almighty  Allah  who  is  not

               defeated by anyone.

                                   Al  Biruni  is  a  Muslim  scientist.  Just  like

                           children  in  his  time,  he  was  educated  at  a
                           young  age  by  studying  Arabic  and  Persian,

                           basic  Islamic  sciences,  and  natural  sciences.

                           When  he  was  17  years  old,  he  was  able  to
                           calculate the latitude of Kath Khawarizmi using

                           the sun's altitude. He also became a specialist
                           in this field of science and became a prominent

                           Muslim scientist who produced great works.




                       Now, our salih salihah syudent must be enthusiastic about learning mathematics
               so that they become the next generation of Al Biruni.

               because they were arrogant?

               The abundant garden produce made the 'Ad people arrogant.
               They are not grateful to Allah.

               Finally, Allah punished them in the form of a disaster.

               All his gardens were damaged by the disaster.
               That's why we have to thank Allah.

               We must protect and care for the environment.

                    " Allah berfirman: Di bumi itu kamu hidup dan di bumi itu kamu mati, dan dari
                                    bumi itu (pula) kamu akan dibangkitkan."

                                                (QS. Al A’raf: 25)


                                                       Aliya and Rizal are grateful to Allah SWT for being

                                                       given eyes to see the beautiful nature. They can
                                                       see that the place they live in is very beautiful and

                                                       comfortable.  But  they  can  never  see  directly  the

                                                       planet they live on. As explained in the Al-Qur'an
                                                       surah Al A'raf verse 25, that on this earth we live

                                                       and  on  this earth  we die, and from the  earth  we

               take care of our earth that Allah SWT gave us to live in.


                      Al-Biruni, The First Counting Muslim Scientist Around the Earth


                                  Great children, have you ever seen planet Earth

                                                     directly?

                                               Never, miss


                                               A Muslim scientist believes that
                                               the Earth is round and calculates
                                               the circumference of the Earth.



                                                     Who is he?



                                           He  is  Al-Biruni,  known  as  an  experimentalist
                                           scientist. He re-does research on existing and
                                           developing theories to prove their truth. One of

                            SCIENCE PRACTICUM 1: DRYING THING



                                                             Alhamdulillah,  you  have  learned  the  things

                                                      that allow us to live on Earth. We can live on planet
                                                      Earth because there is water, animals, plants, and

                                                      oxygen that Allah SWT has given us. Not only the
                                                      planet  Earth  that  Allah  created,  there  is  one  star

                                                      that is much closer to Earth. That star is the sun.

                                                      The sun provides many benefits for life on Earth.

                        Source: google.co.id                 We  can  do  activities  like  reading  and
                                                      exercising in the morning. During the day and the

               sun is directly above us, for some reason we can feel dazzled and sweaty. We can also
               feel hot during the day, different when the air feels cool at night. Why did it happen?

               Let's do the following science practicum.


               A. Tools and Materials:
                 1.  Tissue or Cloth

                 2.   Water

                   2.  Students take tissue or cloth.

                   3.  Students wet a tissue or cloth with water.

                   4.  Students  put  a  wet  tissue  or  cloth  in  a  place

                       exposed to sunlight.                                       Source: google.co.id
                   5.  Students put the wet tissue or cloth in a place that is not exposed to sunlight.

                   6.  Students observe and compare what happens with two different treatments and
                       write down the observations.

               C. Observation Result:

                  1.  What happens to a wet tissue or cloth when it is placed in the sun?

                                                              as  a  place  to  live  for  humans  and  other

                                                              creatures.  With  His  greatness,  Allah
                                                              created  the  earth  which  has  a  change  of

                                                              time  between  day  and  night.  In  previous
                                                              science  practicum,  we  know  that  the  sun

                                                              can  provide  the  heat  we  need.  During  the

                                                              day the sun is right above us, even though

               we can also do activities, but we need to turn on the lights to see what we are doing.
               Why do we need to turn on the lights at night to do our activities? Let's do the following

               science practicum!


               A. Tools and Materials:

                 1. Ball

                   1.  Students  prepare  practical  tools  and

                      materials.
                                                                                   Source: google.com
                   2.  Students hold the ball as the Earth in the

                      left hand.

                   3.  Students turn off the room lights and observe the ball.
                   4.  Students hold a flashlight as the sun in their right hand and turn it on.

                   5.  Students direct the flashlight on one side of the ball.

                   6.  Students observe the differences and write down the results of the observations.

                              Spiritual Paradigm


                       “Dan perintahkanlah keluargamu melaksanakan salat dan sabar dalam
                       mengerjakannya. Kami tidak meminta rezeki kepadamu, Kamilah yang

                     memberi rezeki kepadamu. Dan akibat (yang baik di akhirat) adalah bagi
                                       orang yang bertakwa.” (Q.S. Taha:132)


                                                    Every  day  Rara  and  family  always  carry  out

                                                    congregational  prayers.  Rara  is  always  enthusiastic

                                                    and  happy  when  praying  together.  Allah  will  reward
                                                    her and her family a lot. One day, her mom forgot to

                                                    wake Rara for pray Fajr and when Rara woke up, she
                                                    was sad because she had missed Fajr prayer. Mom

                                                    apologized  to  Rara  and  she  would  not  do  it  again.

                                                    The next day Rara is able to get up early so that she
               could pray Fajr together. Alhamdulillah, Rara is always happy when carrying out Allah’s

               commands such as in QS. Taha:132

                                             the Al-Qur'an surah Al Hijr verse 74, that Allah can make

                      The Punishment Given by Allah to the Prophet Lut's People


                                      Salih salihah, have you ever seen a rain of stones?

                                                                              Never, miss


                                           It turns out that the people of

                                          Prophet Lut who did not want to
                                          repent were once punished by
                                                      Allah.


                                              Really? How's the story

                                                       miss?

                       Prophet  Lut  was  sent  by  Allah  to
               invite his people to repent and return to the

               right  path.  Prophet  Lut's  struggle  to
               awaken  them  was  carried  out  at  every

               opportunity and at every meeting. Because

               their  morals  were  too  bad,  the  Sodomites
               refused  Prophet  Lut's  invitation.  In  fact,

               they  also  asked  Prophet  Lut  to  stop  his                Source: google.com
               preaching and asked him to leave.

                       Prophet Lut felt that his people could no longer be guided and invited to the

               right path. Finally, he prayed to Allah so that his misguided people would be guided.
               If  it  turns  out  that  the  instructions  are  not  useful  at  all,  Prophet  Lut  begs  for  the

               punishment to be sent down.
                       The punishment given by Allah to the people of Prophet Lut was in the form of

               landslides,  earthquakes,  and  showers  of  stones  that  hit  the  people  of  Sodom  in
               succession.  In  the  blink  of  an  eye,  houses,  buildings  and  other  structures  were

               destroyed.

                       The Earth is made of rocks. You see rocks on the surface of the land. It is not

               so easy to see the rocks under the water.
                       Some rocks are very big and some are very small. Stones are small rocks.

               Many  rocks  are  deep beneath  the  surface of  the Earth.  People dig  out  rocks  in  a
               place called a quarry. They use tools and diggers to get the rocks.

                                                  Ismail,  as  well  as  convey  an  important  order.
                                                  Arriving  in  the  city  of  Mecca,  Prophet  Ibrahim  a.s

                                                  saw  Ismail  a.s  under  a  tree  near  the  Zam  Zam

                                                  water source,  sharpening  his arrows. When Ismail
               a.s  saw  his  father,  he  immediately  got  up  to  greet  him.  Prophet  Ibrahim  a.s  then

               conveyed  the  news  to  Ismail  a.s,  "O  Ishmael!  Allah  has  given  me  an  order."  The
               Prophet  Ismail  a.s  also  said  "Do  what  Allah  has  commanded,  father,"  Prophet

               Ibrahim  a.s  continued  his words,  "Allah also  conveyed  a message for  you  to  help

               me."
               Ismail a.s happily replied, "Okay father, I will help. What is Allah's order?"

               "Allah ordered me to build a house for Him there," said Prophet Ibrahim a.s while
               pointing to a hill that was higher than the land around it.

               Soon  after  that,  this  devout  father  and  son  began  to  build  the  foundation  of  the
               Kaaba.  Prophet  Ismail  a.s  brought  the  stones  while  Prophet  Ibrahim  a.s  built  it.

               When the walls got high, Ismail (as) brought a stone and put it under so that Prophet

               Ibrahim (as) could stand on top of it and continue the construction. When the building
               was finished, Prophet Ibrahim a.s then placed the last stone of the Black Stone in

               one corner of the Kaaba to mark the starting point of Tawaf. Prophet Ibrahim a.s and
               Ismail  then  circled  the  Kaaba  while  saying  the  prayer  "Rabbana  taqobbal  minna

               innaka antassami'ul 'Alim" (QS. Albaqoroh 127).

              Some shapes are 2D.

              2D shapes have straight or curved lines
              This shape has no height.

              Sometimes they have both straight and curved lines.

              Example: square, rectangle, triangle, and circle.

              Some shapes are 3D. 3D shapes are solid object.
              A 3D shape takes up space.

              We can see length, height, and width.
              Some 3D shapes have edges and faces and some have curved surfaces.

              some shapes are big.

              Some shapes are small.
              Some look the same all the time, other look different when we turn them.

              Example: cube, cuboid, pyramid, spheres, and cylinder.

               Do you know what caused the flood? ……………………………………………

               Yes, that's right, one of the causes is the garbage that have filled the river.
               We must be wise in processing waste; don't let the waste we produce create

               disasters for ourselves and others.

               We must work together with the community.
               Let's manage our waste starting today! one of the ways is separate waste by type.

                                            Have you ever heard Rasulullah doing housework?

                                            Rasulullah was a role model for Muslims. Rasulullah did not

                                            feel  embarrassed  about  doing  housework.  Rasulullah

                                            worked together with his wife, Aisyah ra. Rasullah swept

                                            the floors, washed dishes and sewed clothes, while Aisyah

                                            did other work. Masha Allah, Rasulullah is so noble. He is

                                            truly a role model for all of us.

                                             Alhamdulillah, we have previously learned how to recycle

                                             waste.

                                             One of them is making collage works.
                                             Take a look at the collage example on the side!

                                             The  collage  art  on  the  side  can  be  used  to  decorate
                                             recycled waste products.

                                             The collage decoration will beautify the recycled products.

               Here's  an  example  of  a  collage  and  how  to  make  it  that  we  can  use  to  decorate
               recycled products.

                              Spiritual Paradigm


                   “Sesungguhnya  Allah  Maha  indah  dan  mencintai  keindahan.”  (HR.
                   Muslim)



                                      Allah created the universe so beautifully.

                                      Allah also loves beauty.
                                      Rasulullah has set an example to maintain beauty.

                                      How did the Messenger of Allah maintain beauty?

                                      Come see the story of the Prophet Muhammad!


                                         The Prophet gave many            Masyaallah, How are
                                         examples in maintaining          the way miss?

                                         beauty.









                                          The Prophet was a role model in all things. One of them

                                          is  maintaining  beauty.  The  Prophet  maintained  beauty

                                          not only in what was seen but also in what was heard.

                                          This  means  that  the  Prophet  kept  himself  and  the

                                          environment clean so that it looked beautiful to look at.

                                          The Prophet also took care of his speech so that every

                                          word he said sounded beautiful. This is what we must

                                          emulate from the Prophet in maintaining the beauty of

                                          speech and behavior.

                                                           LAYERS OF SOIL




                       Allah SWT has shown his greatness by creating the earth

               and everything in it. Earth has an atmosphere, hydrosphere and

               lithosphere. The lithosphere is the layer of the earth composed of
               soil and rock. This layer has a great influence and can be utilized

               by humans. As explained in QS. Az Zariyat verse 48, that Allah
               SWT has shown his greatness by creating the earth with all its

               benefits for humans. So we should always be grateful. Let's do

                       Allah SWT has shown his greatness by creating the earth and

               everything in it in the best form. Things have shapes. Like the earth is a
               ball, the Ka’aba is a cube, and the pyramid also the shape. We must

               not reject the provisions that Allah has determined, as explained in QS.
               Ar Ra'd  Zariyat  verse  41.  So  we  must  always  carry  out  all  of  Allah's

               commands  and  stay  away  from  all  of  his  prohibitions.  Let's  do  an

               experiment about 3D builds!
